# Design Patterns

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) zegt:

`In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.`

# Architecural Patterns

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern) zegt:

`An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.[1] Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope. The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.`

# MVC - Model

* Business Logica
* Data
* Centraal stuk, over héél de applicatie.
